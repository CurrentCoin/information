Genesis
------

We are working to bring convenient and effective solutions to market.

Software deployment and web services, as they currrently exist, are difficult to use. We want to streamline the steps and make it better for everyone, using smart contracts and the code behind the Ethereum network to optimize the experience and the technology.
