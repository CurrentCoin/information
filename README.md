Genesis
------

We are working to bring convenient and effective solutions to market.

Software deployment and web services, as they currrently exist, are difficult to use. We want to streamline the steps and make it better for everyone, using smart contracts and the code behind the Ethereum network to optimize the experience and the technology.

Templates
------

Most users use pre-made templates, but anyone can create a new template. The [brand page template](https://github.com/CurrentCoin/template-brand-page) and the [info spinner template](https://github.com/CurrentCoin/template-info-spinner) are examples of CurrentCoin templates.

A valid CurrentCoin template must have the following:

- A file named `interface.json` which specifies user adjustable parameters, their type, and default values.
- A file named `index.js` which exports a React component. This component must accept the user adjustable parameters as props. 

See the examples for the specifics of how the `interface.json` file is structured.

To test your template within CurrentCoin Create, clone the `currentcoin-prototype` repo and put your template in the folder `web-app/src/servicePreviews` alongside the other templates.

Start the web-app by running

`cd web-app`

`npm install`

`npm start`

Now you can test out your template in the browser. Note that the deploy feature will not work because your template is not yet part of the CurrentCoin system. Make a pull request, and if approved, your template will be available to anyone to deploy a live version.
